The sky wore silver like a borrowed crown  
Footsteps echoed through the sleeping town  
A whisper danced across the windowpane  
Hope was humming in the midnight rain  
Lanterns flickered with a quiet grace  
Time stood still in that forgotten place  
The wind remembered what the stars forgot  
And morning bloomed from a single thought
